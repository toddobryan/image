Shapes
======

Most shapes have filled and outlined versions and are created by using the
`apply()` method of a convenience object.

The first argument for a filled shape is always a `Color`, which is, 
not surprisingly, the color of the shape's interior. (Hopefully this will be
enhanced later to allow for patterns and gradients, so the type you'll see
in the documentation is actually `Paint`. Right now, the only kind of `Paint`
you can use is a `Color`.)

We explain more about `Color`s later, but for right now, know that you can use
all of the HTML color names by writing `Color.Name`. If you just have to know
all of the possible colors, go to the [Scaladoc API](latest/api/) and click on
the `Color` object to see the complete list. Or just keep reading and you'll
see several in the examples below.

The first argument to an outlined shape is either a `Color` or a `Pen`. By
default, all outlines are drawn so that they appear exactly one pixel wide,
no matter how large or small you magnify the image. If you'd like a beefier
line, create a `Pen(color, width)`, where `color` is the pen's color and 
`width` is how wide the line will appear in pixels.

Sizes are always expressed in pixels. Since the sizes are `Double`s, fractional
pixels are allowed, but they'll be fit into the pixels of your display device,
so they might do something different than you expect.

## Curves

There are four basic curvy shapes: circles and ellipses, filled and outlined.

### Circles

```scala
CircleFilled(color: Paint, radius: Double): Image  
CircleOutlined(color: Paint, radius: Double): Image
CircleOutlined(pen: Pen, radius: Double): Image
```

For circles, the two required arguments are a `Color` or `Pen` and the size of
the radius. (In the examples that follow, I'm going to show you the code you'd
use to create an `Image` and the image that would result. Remember that if you
actually want to see the image, you'll have to call it's `.display()` method.)

```scala
scala> CircleFilled(Color.Blue, 30)
```  
@CircleFilled(Color.Blue, 30).inlineImgTag  
```scala
scala> CircleOutlined(Color.Red, 25)
```  
@CircleOutlined(Color.Red, 25).inlineImgTag

### Ellipses

```scala
EllipseFilled(color: Paint, width: Double, height: Double): Image
EllipseOutlined(color: Paint, width: Double, height: Double): Image
EllipseOutlined(pen: Pen, width: Double, height: Double): Image
```

For ellipses, there are three required arguments, the color, the width, and
the height. Note that these are the total width and height, so a circle with
radius 30 would have a width and height of 60.

```scala
scala> EllipseFilled(Color.Aquamarine, 50, 100)
```  
@EllipseFilled(Color.Aquamarine, 50, 100).inlineImgTag  
```scala
scala> EllipseOutlined(Pen(Color.Cyan, 5), 200, 25)
```  
@EllipseOutlined(Pen(Color.Cyan, 5), 200, 25).inlineImgTag

## Squares, Rectangles, and Regular Polygons

Squares, rectangles, and regular polygons get special treatment, and they're
very similar to circles and ellipses.

### Squares

```scala
SquareFilled(color: Paint, side: Double): Image
SquareOutlined(color: Paint, side: Double): Image
SquareOutlined(pen: Pen, side: Double): Image
```

The second argument to `SquareFilled` or `SquareOutlined` is the square's
side length.

### Rectangles

```scala
RectangleFilled(color: Paint, width: Double, height: Double): Image
RectangleOutlined(color: Paint, width: Double, height: Double): Image
RectangleOutlined(pen: Pen, width: Double, height: Double): Image
```

### RegularPolygons

```scala
RegularPolygonFilled(color: Paint, sideLength: Double, numSides: Double): Image
RegularPolygonOutlined(color: Paint, sideLength: Double, numSides: Double): Image
RegularPolygonOutlined(pen: Pen, sideLength: Double, numSides: Double): Image
```
