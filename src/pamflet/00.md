Image
=====

The *Image* library is a port (mostly) of the `htdp2e/image` library created
for Racket by Robby Findler. It also includes some extensions created by Stephen
Bloch for his book *Picturing Programs*.

The library allows users to functionally create images based on geometric
figures and bitmaps.
