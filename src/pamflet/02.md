Bitmaps
=======

## Built-in Bitmaps

To get you started quickly, a number of bitmap images from
Stephen Bloch's book *Picturing Programs* are included. These are:

* `Book` ![image.Book](files/qbook.png)
* `Calendar` ![image.Calendar](files/calendar.png)
* `Glyphs` ![image.Glyphs](files/hieroglyphics.png)
* `Hacker` ![image.Hacker](files/mad-hacker.png)
* `StickPerson` ![image.StickPerson](files/stick-figure.png)
* `TrainCar` ![image.TrainCar](files/train-car.png)
* `TrainEngine` ![image.TrainEngine](files/train-engine.png)

If you're using the normal console, you won't see the pretty images when you
type these.

```scala
scala> Hacker
res0: org.dupontmanual.image.Bitmap = Hacker
```

However, you can see the image by calling the `display()` method on it. This
method will create a dialog box with the image inside.

```scala
scala> Hacker.display()
```

will give you something like  
![dialog of Hacker image](files/hacker-dialog.png)  
Either click OK or press return to close the dialog box and get back to your
console.

## Bitmaps from Files

If you'd like to use your own bitmaps, you can load an image from the
filesystem. 

Suppose you've saved this lovely image of the letter 'H'  
![picture of letter H](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/H.png)  
to the same directory as your project. You can access it with

```scala
scala> Bitmap("H.png")
res1: org.dupontmanual.image.Bitmap = Bitmap("H.png")
```

You can save it in a `val` and display it, just like the built-in images.

```scala
scala> val h: Image = Bitmap("H.png")
h: org.dupontmanual.image.Image = Bitmap("H.png")

scala> h.display()
```

should show you a nice dialog box. Note that images aren't read from the file
until they're needed, so if the file is missing, you mis-typed the name, or
the file isn't really an image, you won't get an error message until you've
tried to use the image in some way.

## Bitmaps from the Web

You can also grab images from the internet, if you have their URL. For
example, to grab that lovely 'H' from where I found it on the WikiMedia site,
you do:

```scala
scala> val netH: Image = Bitmap.fromUrl("http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/H.png")
netH: org.dupontmanual.image.Image = Bitmap.fromUrl("http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/H.png")

scala> netH.display()
```

should show you the image. Note that images are grabbed from the internet the
first time they're needed, so if you're not connected to the net, or you've
typed the wrong URL, you will get an error.
