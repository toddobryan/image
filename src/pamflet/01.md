Overview
========

The most common way to use the library is to just import everything:

```scala
scala> import org.dupontmanual.image._
```

Most functions create `Image` instances. The most basic of these are `Bitmap` images, which you can create from either a file path or a URL.

If you save this image ![picture of letter H](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/H.png) into the directory you're working in, you can do the following:

```scala
scala> val h: Image = Bitmap("H.png")
h: org.dupontmanual.image.Bitmap = Bitmap("H.png")

scala> val w: Image = Bitmap.fromUrl("http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/W.png")
w: org.dupontmanual.image.Image = Bitmap.fromUrl("http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/W.png")
```

This doesn't look very exciting until you realize that all `Image` objects have a wonderful little method called `display()`. If you type

```scala
scala> h.display()
```

you should get a little dialog box with the image of that 'H' in it. Click OK to
make it disappear, and then try

```scala
scala> w.display()
```

to see that you can also grab images from the internet.
