Overview
========

The most common way to use the library is to just import everything::

    scala> import org.dupontmanual.image._

Once you've done that, you can happily write all the code in the sections
that follow.

Library Dependency
------------------

To use ``dm-image`` in your own SBT project, the library dependency is::

    "org.dupontmanual" %% "dm-image" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
