dM Image
========

The *dM Image* library is a port (mostly) of the ``2htdp/image`` library created
for Racket by Robby Findler. It also includes some extensions created by Stephen
Bloch and some images included in Stephen's book *Picturing Programs*.

The library allows users to functionally create images based on geometric
figures and bitmaps.
